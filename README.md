Learn how to build a REST API using Node and MongoDB with this restaurant API project!

Have you ever wanted to give third-party developers an easy way to hook into your platform’s data, allowing you to see what cool new uses for it they come up with?

Maybe you want to make life easier for your internal development projects — such as building mobile clients for your web-based product in a reproducible way.

In this course, you’ll learn to build a REST API for your app. We’ll set up our starter project — in this case, a restaurant API — and then show you how to set up API endpoints for adding data (POST requests) and retrieving data (GET requests).

Later, you’ll expand your API to enable the maintenance of data — creating endpoints that allow records to be updated or deleted.

Projects have a way of changing as development goes on. As a final step, we’ll teach you how to refactor from a restaurant API to a food truck API, restructuring the entire data model.

Aside from building your first API, in this course you’ll learn or improve skills in high-demand technologies like Node.js, MongoDB, ES6 with Babel, and more.

This is part three of a four part series. Get the full benefit by completing them in order:
